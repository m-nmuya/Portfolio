    <p>During my senior year of high school, I collaborated with three peers on a passion project aimed at repurposing a children's ride car into a joystick-controlled mobility device using Arduino Nano and Java programming. Our goal was to donate this innovative solution to a children's rehabilitation center, specifically targeting children too young for motorized wheelchairs. Through this endeavor, I strengthened my technical skills while learning the importance of empathy-driven design and community impact. This project reflects my commitment to using technology for social good and my dedication to collaborative problem-solving for the benefit of marginalized communities.</p>

    <h2><center>Vector Functions</center></h2>

    <p>During my Intro to Computer Organization class at Virginia Tech, I was tasked with developing comprehensive code to compute various vector functions, including critical operations like the dot product, as part of our graded assignments. Utilizing the C programming language, each student was tasked with independently implementing these functionalities. This challenge not only deepened my understanding of vector mathematics and algorithmic problem-solving but also honed my proficiency in C programming. It was a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to practical coding tasks within a structured academic setting, further enhancing my skills and knowledge in computer science.<a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/Wzl"> Here is a link directly to the project</a></p>
    
    <h2><center>Activism Website</center></h2>

    <p>During my senior year of high school, I spearheaded the development of a dynamic website for our computer science volunteer group, employing Python, HTML, and JavaScript to craft a user-friendly platform tailored for parents and volunteers alike. With a focus on accessibility and functionality, I designed diverse pages enabling seamless event registration for children, easy access to our schedule, and insight into the dedicated team driving our organization's mission. This project not only showcased my technical proficiency but also demonstrated my commitment to fostering community engagement and facilitating efficient communication within our volunteer network.<a href="https://replit.com/@MarieMuya1/Activism-Tool-Kit-Marie-Muya"> Here is a link directly to the project</a></p>
    
    <h2><center>My Create PT Project</center></h2>

The scientist is holding a test tube in their right hand." width="90%" height="100%"/></center>

    <p>This is my create project for college board! I completed this project my sophmore year of high school. I was inspired by my Chemisty class and created a game where users could learn about the different families on the periodic table.<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/embed?project=Create%20PT%20%3AD&user=1964113588&showTitle=true&showAuthor=true&editButton=true&pauseButton=true"> Here is a link directly to the project</a></p>

    <h2><center>Standard Algorithms Arrays</center></h2>

    <center><img src="array.PNG" alt="An image of an output window from a project involving standard algorithms and arrays." width="50%" height="50%"/></center>

    <p>This is a projected I created with a partner in my AP Computer Science A class in High School using java. We utlizied standard algorithms and implemented them on differet types of array we created.<a href="https://www.jdoodle.com/iembed/v0/iZA"> Here is a link directly to the project</a></p>

   <h2><center>Iterative Graphics</center></h2>

    <center><img src="lab4.PNG" alt="An image of an house and tree in the center with multiple arcs on the corner of the image window." width="50%" height="50%"/></center>

    <p>This is a projected I created in my AP Computer Science A class in High School using java. The main objective was creating code that utilizes void methods to call each corner and the center object, iteration and nested iteration, color objects, Java graphics, and applet output.<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xTdwz50nBe1RYlNcY6ug9WNB_xUD2CI3VFwKlAJzFqE/edit?usp=sharing"> Here is a link directly to the project</a></p>
