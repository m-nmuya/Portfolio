    Allow me to introduce myself: I'm a Sophomore studying Computer Science at Virginia Tech, deeply passionate about coding. My aspiration is to leverage computational innovation to assist others. Specifically, I'm keen on pursuing a Computer Science degree with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction, complemented by a minor in the same field.
